# Final Project for Digital Talent Scholarship (DTS)

By Fajri Nurfauzan this clone from Github Fajrinurf the account is flaged,

## Project Overview
This project was developed as part of my final assignment for the Digital Talent Scholarship (DTS) program. The main objective of this project is to create a desktop application using Python's Tkinter library.

## About the Project
The application is designed to data analyst. Tkinter was chosen as the primary GUI toolkit due to its simplicity and effectiveness in creating desktop applications in Python.

## Features
- Manajemen Data: CRUD operations on datasets.
- Analisis Data: Basic and advanced data analysis.
- Visualisasi Data: Creation of graphs and plots.
- Machine Learning: Data cleaning, model training, and predictions.
- Export/Import: Export and import data in various formats.

## Purpose
The primary purposes of this project are:
Provide an accessible platform for data analysis: This application is designed to make it easy for users to analyze data without requiring deep technical knowledge.
Integrate multiple functionalities: The application integrates various functions such as data management, visualization, machine learning, and reporting into a single interface.

## Installation
To run this application, make sure you have Python installed. You can then clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fajrinurf/DTS-FGA.git
cd your-repository-name (DTS-FGA)
```

## How to Use
1. Run the application by executing the following command in your terminal:
``` python
python main.py
```
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform data management, analysis, visualization, and machine learning tasks.

## Future Development
While this version of the application meets the requirements for my DTS final project, there are still some areas that require further development:

- Bug Fixes: In future updates, I plan to address and fix several bugs that have been identified in the current version of the application.
- Feature Improvements: Some features are not functioning as perfectly as intended. Future development will focus on refining these features to enhance the overall user experience.

This ongoing development ensures that the application will continue to evolve, providing better stability and more robust functionality.
